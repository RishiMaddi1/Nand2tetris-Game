# Project Title: LavaJumper - A Lava and Water Jumping Tile Game

Description:
LavaJumper is an exciting 2D tile-based game where players navigate through a perilous landscape of randomly generated tiles, avoiding deadly lava while leaping from one platform to another. As players progress, they must skillfully time their jumps to avoid falling into the fiery depths below. Upon completing each level, players face the challenge of navigating rain-soaked platforms to reach the next stage, with new tiles falling from the sky onto the molten lava.

Key Features:

Dynamic tile generation: Randomly generated platforms create a unique and challenging gameplay experience with each playthrough.
Fluid physics simulation: Realistic water and lava mechanics add depth and complexity to the game environment.
Intuitive controls: Simple yet responsive controls allow players to jump and navigate the terrain with ease.
Progressive difficulty: Increasingly challenging levels test players' agility and timing skills as they advance through the game.
Interactive environment: Rainfall mechanics alter the game world, influencing platform behavior and creating new gameplay opportunities.
